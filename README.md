# Java Testing with JUnit

 ## üìå Description
This project focuses on implementing and testing various functionalities using **JUnit.**

In this project **Maven** has been used to create and use the necessary dependencies.

The language used was **Java (jdk23).**

It has been carried out in the **IntelliJ IDE**

## üìùLevel 1: JUnit

### Exercise 1: Library Book Collection Management
Create a Java class to manage a collection of books in a library. The class should allow the following operations:

#### Functionalities:
- Add books to the collection.
- Retrieve the complete list of books.
- Get the title of a book by its position.
- Insert a book at a specific position.
- Remove a book by title.

#### JUnit Tests:
- Verify that the book list is not null after creating a new object.
- Ensure the list has the expected size after adding multiple books.
- Confirm that a specific book is in the correct position.
- Ensure that there are no duplicate book titles in the list.
- Check that a book title can be retrieved by its specific position.
- Verify that adding a book correctly modifies the list.
- Confirm that removing a book decreases the list size.
- Ensure that the list remains sorted alphabetically after adding or removing a book.

### Exercise 2: DNI Letter Calculation
Create a class named `CalculoDni` that calculates the letter of a Spanish DNI (National Identification Number) based on its number.

#### JUnit Tests:
- Implement a JUnit test class that validates its functionality.
- Parameterize the test to receive a broad range of data.
- Validate the correct letter calculation for 10 predefined DNI numbers.

### Exercise 3: Exception Handling
Create a class with a method that throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

#### JUnit Tests:
- Verify its correct handling with a JUnit test.
